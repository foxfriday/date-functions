* Date Functions

This is a small library with some date utilities, mostly to determine if a given
date is a holiday and things like that. The date functions are for the United
States, but other holidays could be easily added. The library's main functions
are intended to be used in your diary file like ~sexp entries~.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
%%(df-diary-expirations 1 -1) Last work day of the month
%%(df-diary-expirations 25 -1 df-globex-holidays) First work day before the 25
%%(df-diary-expirations 25 -3 df-globex-holidays t personal-expiration-face) WTI Expiration
#+end_src

If you are using ~org-mode~, you can use the functions as follows:

#+begin_src
SCHEDULED: %%(df-diary-expirations 1 -1)
#+end_src
